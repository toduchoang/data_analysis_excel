This is a People Team dashboard built in Excel. I used advanced excel formulas to calculate Tenure, Headcount, Turnover, and then used Pivot Tables and Slicer to create a dashboard.
You can find Headcount, Turnover, Tenure, Compensation, and DEI metrics there to quickly understand the company's current workforce composition.
